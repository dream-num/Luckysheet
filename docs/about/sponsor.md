# Sponsor

## Why sponsor

If you run a business and is using Luckysheet in a revenue-generating product, it would make business sense to sponsor Luckysheet development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the Luckysheet community and more people pay attention to your products.

Of course, individual users are also welcome to buy author a glass of juice if Luckysheet has helped you in your work or personal projects 😋.
